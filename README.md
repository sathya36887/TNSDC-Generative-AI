The natural language processing (NLP) project is centered around the development of a sentiment analysis system to automatically evaluate and classify the sentiment expressed in textual data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, or survey responses. The project encompasses various stages, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Leveraging advanced NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system aims to accurately categorize text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing valuable insights for businesses to understand customer feedback, identify emerging trends, and make data-driven decisions. The ultimate goal of the project is to empower businesses with the capability to efficiently analyze large volumes of text data, extract actionable insights, and enhance overall customer satisfaction and experience.
